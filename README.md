# Collected
A collection of some of my favourite projects spanning machine learning and neural networks, data visualisation, and natural language processing.

## Machine Learning
- [Hidden CKD](https://github.com/edwardbensa/hidden-ckd) - Classification algorithms for predicting the risk of developing chronic kidney disease.
- [Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/edwardbensa/hd-prediction) - Classification algorithms for predicting the risk of developing heart disease.
- [Breast Cancer Prediction](https://github.com/edwardbensa/breast-cancer-prediction) - ML algorithms for predicting breast cancer mortality.
- [Singapore Flat Resale](https://github.com/edwardbensa/sg-flat-resale) - Time series analysis of flat resale prices in Singapore.

## Data Visualisation
- [Singapore Flat Resale](https://github.com/edwardbensa/sg-flat-resale) - Visualisation of flat resale prices in Singapore.
- [Farming Practices Survey](https://github.com/edwardbensa/farming-practices-survey) - Visualisation of farming practices (with a focus on antimicrobial use) across various farm types and regions in Ghana.
